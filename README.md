### This project addresses the challenge of detecting fraudulent credit card transactions, a classic case of highly imbalanced data where frauds make up less than 0.2% of total transactions.

## The solution combines:

### ‚Ä¢ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand fraud behavior

### ‚Ä¢ Anomaly Detection Models (Isolation Forest + DBSCAN with PCA)

### ‚Ä¢ SQL-based querying for analytical insights

### ‚Ä¢ Power BI Dashboard for interactive fraud monitoring

## üéØ Objectives

### ‚Ä¢ Explore fraud vs. normal transaction patterns.

### ‚Ä¢ Build unsupervised anomaly detection models suitable for imbalanced datasets.

### ‚Ä¢ Tune thresholds to improve recall for fraud cases.

### ‚Ä¢ Provide business-friendly insights through Power BI dashboards.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### ‚Ä¢ Programming: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn)

### ‚Ä¢ Anomaly Detection: Isolation Forest, DBSCAN, PCA

### ‚Ä¢ Database: SQLite + SQL queries

### ‚Ä¢ Visualization: Power BI

### ‚Ä¢ Other Tools: Jupyter Notebook

### ‚Ä¢ The Power BI dashboard visualizes:

### ‚Ä¢ Total Transactions: 284,807

### ‚Ä¢ Fraud Cases: 492 (‚âà0.17%)

### ‚Ä¢ Fraud Amount vs. Normal Amount

### ‚Ä¢ Fraud distribution by time of day

### ‚Ä¢ Filters for transaction type, amount, and PCA features

## üöÄ Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing & EDA

#### ‚Ä¢ Removed duplicates (1081).

#### ‚Ä¢ Checked missing values ‚Üí none found.

#### ‚Ä¢ Scaled transaction amounts with StandardScaler.

#### ‚Ä¢ Extracted Hour feature from transaction time.

#### ‚Ä¢ Visualized transaction amounts, fraud distribution, and feature correlations.

### 2. Anomaly Detection Models

#### ‚Ä¢ Isolation Forest: Trained on scaled features with contamination detection.

#### ‚Ä¢ DBSCAN + PCA: Reduced dimensionality for clustering anomalies.

#### ‚Ä¢ Combined approach: Merged results from Isolation Forest & DBSCAN.

#### ‚Ä¢ Threshold tuning: Improved recall for fraud transactions.

### üìå Best Results (Isolation Forest tuned):

#### ‚Ä¢ Accuracy: 99.78%

#### ‚Ä¢ Fraud Recall: ~34% (detected 1 in 3 fraud cases)

#### ‚Ä¢ Fraud Precision: ~35%

### 3. SQL Analysis

#### ‚Ä¢ Counted total vs. fraud transactions.

#### ‚Ä¢ Calculated fraud percentage (0.17%).

#### ‚Ä¢ Fraud transactions by hour of day ‚Üí peak at 11 AM‚Äì12 PM.

#### ‚Ä¢ Analyzed PCA features (e.g., V14 strongly correlated with fraud).

### 4. Visualization in Power BI

#### ‚Ä¢ Designed interactive dashboard for fraud monitoring.

#### ‚Ä¢ KPI cards (fraud %, fraud amount, max fraud transaction).

#### ‚Ä¢ Distribution plots and filters for deeper insights.

## üìà Key Insights

#### ‚Ä¢ Fraud transactions are very rare (‚âà0.17%).

#### ‚Ä¢ Fraudulent amounts are smaller than typical transaction amounts.

#### ‚Ä¢ Fraud shows time-of-day patterns (peaks around 11 AM).

#### ‚Ä¢ PCA feature V14 < -5 is a strong fraud indicator.

## üë• Project Collaboration

## This project was completed as part of an internship group project.
